The CAMPS database holds crucial objects that defined the paths drawn by CAMPS.
Map-Editor is a GUI that allows an administrator to quickly and seamlessly change
these database objects in a way intuitive to humans. All changes are updated real-time
into the database.
<p>The three database objects are:<br>
  <strong>Building Nodes </strong><br>
  Represents a building on campus. Each node is defined in terms of &lt;Name,
  Abbreviated name, Node ID, Pixel X-location, Pixel Y-location&gt;. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; <em>Name</em> &#8211; The full name of the building,
  as defined by http://www.washington.edu/home/maps.
  For example, Chemistry Library Bldg.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; <em>Abbreviated Name</em> &#8211; The abbreviated
  name of the building (also defined by the above website). For example, CHL.
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; <em>Node ID</em> &#8211; The database integer id
  key particular to this node.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; <em>Pixel X-location</em> &#8211; The x-value of
  the node location, with the origin centered at the top-left corner of the campus
  map.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; <em>Pixel Y-location</em> &#8211; The y-value of
  the node location.<br>
  <strong>Path Nodes</strong><br>
  Represents a non-building location on campus. They define the path between buildings.
  Each node is defined in terms of &lt;Node ID, Pixel X-location, Pixel Y-location&gt;.
  Node ID, Pixel X-location, and Pixel Y-location are the same as for Building
  Nodes. Note that Building Nodes and Path Nodes are actually both node types
  in the database.<br>
  <strong>Edges </strong><br>
  Represent paths between two nodes on campus. These can be either Building Nodes
  or Path Nodes. Each edge is defined in terms of &lt;Node1, Node2, Direction,
  Path Type&gt;. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; <em>Node 1</em> &#8211; The start node defining the
  edge.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; <em>Node 2</em> &#8211; The destination node defining
  the edge.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; <em>Direction</em> &#8211; Either bi-directional
  or not bi-directional. Bi-directional means the edge can be traveled from node1
  to node2 or vice versa. Not bi-directional means the edge can only be traveled
  from node1 to node2. This may the be case for one-way doors.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; <em>Path Type </em>&#8211; Currently, either Default
  or Stairs. Default represents all non-stairs paths. The Path Type is important
  in cases where traveling is done a bike, wheelchair, or other mechanism that
  might make stair travel difficult or impossible. Future extensions of Path Type
  and traveling method can result in more variations.</p>
<p><strong>Map-Editor allows an admin to change these objects with powerful
  built-in GUI tools, layed out on the back-drop of the actual UW Campus, so WYSIWYG
  (what you see is what you get). Please read the User&#8217;s Manual to learn
  how to use Map-Editor. </strong></p>

  Map-Editor is visually split up into 4 sections, from top to down. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The <strong>Menu Toolbar </strong>(File, Change Colors).
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The <strong>Output Textbox Pane</strong>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The <strong>Map Interface</strong>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The <strong>Bottom Control Panel</strong>. <br>
  We will discuss each in detail, in the order that you should learn it. Map Interface,
  Bottom Control Panel, Output Textbox Pane, and Menu Toolbar.</p>
<p><font color="#0066FF" size="4">Map Interface</font><br>
  - Right-click and drag to move around the map.<br>
  - Building nodes are represented by the sold blue circle with the building&#8217;s
  abbreviated name attached.<br>
  - Path nodes are represented by the blue concentric circle.<br>
  - Edges/paths are represented by the green lines. They are by default bidirectional,
  which is indicated by to arrows that point in opposite directions (looks like
  a bow-tie).</p>
<p><font color="#0066FF" size="4">Bottom Control Panel</font><br>
  First, let&#8217;s discuss the radio buttons. They are Add Node, Add Building,
  Add/Edit Path, Remove Node, and Move Node. <br>
  <strong>Add Node:</strong><br>
  Allows you to add Path Nodes. Click anywhere on the Map Interface to add a Path
  Node at that location. A blue concentric circle appears on the Map Interface,
  indicating the position of the Path Node. <br>
  Note: for all radio button options, both left-click and right-click work. But
  if you right-click and drag (to move around the map) the radio button action
  will not be taken. <br>
  <strong>Add Building:</strong><br>
  Allows you to add Building Nodes. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click anywhere on the Map Interface to add a Building
  Node at that location. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. An input textbox pop-up will ask for the &#8220;Full Name
  of the new Building&#8221;. Type in the full-name of the building. Eg, Kane
  Hall. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Press OK. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. An input textbox pop-up will ask for the &#8220;Abbreviation
  of the new Building&#8221;. Type in the abbreviation of the building. For example,
  KNE.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Press OK.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. A solid blue circle appears on the Map Interface, indicating
  the position of the new Building Node.<br>
  <strong>Add/Edit Path: </strong><br>
  Allows you to create/edit the edge/path between two nodes. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click on the first node (either Path Node or Building
  Node) defining the edge you want to create (or already exists). The node will
  be highlighted green, indicating your selection.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click on the second node defining the edge. The node will
  be highlighted red, indicating your selection. A pop-up menu will appear. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; Checkmark the Bi-directional box
  to make the edge bi-directional (traveling is allowed either from 1st node to
  2nd node or vice versa).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; Uncheckmark the Bi-directional
  box to make the edge non-bi-directional (traveling is only allowed from the
  1st node to the 2nd node).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; Arrows along the path on the Map
  Interface visually show which directions are allowed.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; Select the Path Type from the
  drop down menu. Currently, Default and Stairs are supported.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; Click the Remove Edge button (only
  appears if the edge already exists) to delete the edge.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; Click OK to finalize your selection.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; Click Cancel to cancel your selection.
  <br>
  <strong>Remove Node:</strong><br>
  Allows you to remove nodes (either Path Nodes or Building Nodes). Click on a
  node in the Map Interface, and a pop-up box will appear, asking &#8220;You have
  clicked on a node, would you like to delete it?&#8221; Click Yes to delete the
  node. Click No to not delete the node. <br>
  <strong>Move Node:</strong><br>
  Allows you to move nodes. Click on a node in the Map Interface. The node will
  be highlighted green, indicating your selection. Use your keyboard arrow keys
  to move the node up, left, down, or right. This allows for small adjustments.
  If you want to move a node large distances, delete the node and a new one.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s discuss the other functions on the Bottom Control Panel. <br>
  <strong>Path Defaults Drop-down Menu: </strong><br>
  Allows you to change the default path type. Once changed, new edges created
  will have the path type defaulted to the new value. <br>
  <strong>Bi-Directional Checkbox:</strong><br>
  Allows you to change the default directional mode. Check it to make new edges
  default to bi-directional. Uncheck it to make new edges default to uni-directional.<br>
  <strong>Refresh Data: </strong><br>
  Allows you to refresh the Map Interface. If someone else is also using the Map-Editor
  concurrently, Refresh Data updates the changes they made to your Map Interface.<br>
  <strong>Reset: </strong><br>
  Clears all selections on the Map Interface. For example, if you have a selected
  a node, clicking Reset will clear your selection.<br>
  <strong>Show Picture Checkbox: </strong><br>
  Uncheck this to not display the campus map background. The nodes all the edges
  will still display. May improve scrolling performance. <br>
  <strong>Non-Building Destinations Checkbox: </strong><br>
  Uncheck this to not display Path Nodes. Allows you to focus on the Building
  Nodes and the paths between them.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#0066FF" size="4">Output Textbox Pane</font><br>
  Displays information about your interaction with the Map Interface. When you
  add a Path Node or a Building Node, it will display &#8220;Added new node&#8221;
  or &#8220;Added new building&#8221;. When you create/edit a path, it will display
  node information in the form [Node Id] at [X-Pixel],[Y-Pixel]. </p>
<p><font color="#0066FF" size="4">Menu Toolbar</font><br>
  <em>File</em> &#8211; Allows you to exit the program.<br>
  <em>Change Colors</em> &#8211; Allows you to change the colors of Map Interface
  components (Node, Paths, Start Node for edges, End Node for edges). </p>
