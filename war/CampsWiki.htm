<ul>
  <li><b>Q</b> What are the system requirements?<br />
  <b>A</b> This website requires a modern browser to work (such as Firefox or Safari). A high speed connection and fast computer are not required, but make the user experience more delightful. Internet Explorer 7 is required because previous versions don't support transparent PNGs. Safari doesn't support changing the transportation type while a path is on the map, but the <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org/">Safari nightlies</a> work.</li>
