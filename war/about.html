<p><font color="#0000FF" size="5"><center>Why CAMPS?</center></font></p>
 <p> 
  Ever been lost on the UW campus? Ever wondered if there&#8217;s a better way to 
  get to your next class? </p>
<p><strong>Well wonder no more. </strong></p>
<p><strong>CAMPS</strong> (Campus Mapping Service) is a web service that allows 
  you to easily plan out your whole day&#8217;s walking (or running, biking, wheelchair) 
  schedule, from building to building. Simply type in building names in the order 
  on your schedule. CAMPS will display a map of the shortest-route path from building 
  to building, as well as time and distance estimates. </p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Never get lost again. </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Always go the shortest route. </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan your trip precisely so you can grab those last oh-so-needed minutes 
    of sleep in the morning. </li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#8217;t travel a campus without it.</p>

<p>Written by students, for students. The UW Campus Mapping Service was a project for an undergraduate-level Computer Science class (<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse403/07wi/">CSE 403</a>) at the University of Washington during Winter quarter, 2007. The application was developed in its entirety from scratch over a period of ~6 weeks by a team of 6 incredibly handsome Computer Science students:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ryan Adams</b> - Client/Server Integration, Server Code, and Standalone Application</li>
<li><b>Jian Chen</b> - Server Code and Unit Testing</li>
<li><b>Andrew Hitchcock</b> - Client/Server Integration, (AJAX) Building Lookup Functionality, and Destination List</li>
<li><b>Justin Lundberg</b> - Search Algorithm and Server Code</li>
<li><b>Dale Olson</b> - Scrolling (AJAX) Map Interface and Associated Controls</li>
<li><b>Charley Zhang</b> - Tomcat Development/Integration, Server Code, and Documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="5"><center>Cool Technology</center></font></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The graphical (AJAX) portion of the application was developed with help from the <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit">Google Web Toolkit</a> (and is written in Java, believe it or not!)</li>
<li>We also developed a powerful utility to allow easy modification of map destinations and paths.</li>
<li>The server (which does the complicated algorithmic work for CAMPS) was also written in Java and runs on Apache Tomcat.</li>
<li>For calculating shortest paths quickly we used Dijkstra's algorithm, which you get to learn about in the CS Data Structures class.</li>
</ul>

<p>CAMPS development is hosted on Sourceforge.net and is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). In other words, it is awesome, free, and anyone interested can check out our code and modify it to suit their needs. We only ask that you give us credit for our work. Visit our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/camps/">project page</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for using CAMPS. We hope that it makes your life a little bit easier and the campus a bit less confusing. While we are no longer actively supporting this application (C&C has taken over), we would still like to <a href="mailto:camps-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">hear what you have to say</a> -- positive feedback is appreciated because it might help us get a job some day!
